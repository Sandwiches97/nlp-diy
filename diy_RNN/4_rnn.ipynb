    "Thus, broadcasting (see [Section 2.1.3](https://d2l.ai/chapter_preliminaries/ndarray.html#subsec-broadcasting)) is applied during the summation. Next, the hidden variable $\\mathbf{H}$ is used as the input of the output layer. The output layer is given by\n",

From the relationship between hidden variables $\\mathbf{H}_t$ and $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ of adjacent time steps, we know that these variables captured and retained the sequence's historical information up to their current time step, just like the state or memory of the neural network's current time step. Therefore, such a hidden variable is called a ***hidden state***. Since the hidden state uses the same definition of the previous time step in the current time step, the computation of [(8.4.5)](https://d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-neural-networks/rnn.html#equation-rnn-h-with-state) is ***recurrent***.

If we want to compress text, we can ask about predicting the next token given the current set of tokens. **A better language model** should allow us to predict the next token more accurately. **Thus**, it should allow us to spend **fewer bits in compressing the sequence**.
