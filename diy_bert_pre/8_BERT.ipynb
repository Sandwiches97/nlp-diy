    "- word2vec和GloVe等词嵌入模型与**上下文无关**。它们将相同的预训练向量赋给同一个词，而不考虑词的上下文（如果有的话）。它们很难处理好自然语言中的一词多义或复杂语义。\n",
    "- 对于**上下文敏感**的词表示，如ELMo和GPT，词的表示依赖于它们的上下文。但是二者都有缺点：\n",
    "  - ELMo对上下文进行双向编码，但使用特定于任务的架构（然而，为每个自然语言处理任务设计一个特定的体系架构实际上并不容易）；\n",
    "  - 而GPT是任务无关的，但是从左到右编码上下文。\n",
    "- BERT结合了这两个方面的优点：它对上下文进行双向编码，并且需要对大量自然语言处理任务进行最小的架构更改。\n",
    "- BERT输入序列的嵌入是**词元嵌入**、**片段嵌入**和**位置嵌入**的和。\n",
    "- 预训练包括两个任务：\n",

    "  - **next sentence prediction (NSP)**，显式地建模文本对之间的逻辑关系。\n",
    "\n",
    "We have introduced several word embedding models for natural language understanding. After pretraining, the output can be thought of as a matrix where each row is a vector that represents a word of a predefined vocabulary. In fact, these word embedding models are all  **context-independent** . Let us begin by illustrating this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1. From Context-Independent to Context-Sensitive\n",
    "\n",
    "we know the `word2vec` and `GloVe` method both assign the same pretrained vector to the same word **regardless of the context of the word.** （二者都没有考虑上下文）\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a context-independent representation of any token $x$ is a function $f(x)$ that **only takes $x$ as its input**. Given the abundance of polysemy and complex semantics in natural languages, context-independent representations have **obvious limitations**. For instance, the word “crane” in contexts “a crane is flying” and “a crane driver came” has completely different meanings; thus, **the same word may be assigned different representations depending on contexts.** （ 一个词可以根据上下文被赋予不同的含义）\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivates the development of **context-sensitive** word representations, where representations of words depend on their contexts. Hence, a context-sensitive representation of token x is **a function f(x,c(x)) depending on both x and its context c(x)**. Popular context-sensitive representations include **TagLM** (language-model-augmented sequence tagger) [[Peters et al., 2017b]](https://d2l.ai/chapter_references/zreferences.html#peters-ammar-bhagavatula-ea-2017), **CoVe** (Context Vectors) [[McCann et al., 2017]](https://d2l.ai/chapter_references/zreferences.html#mccann-bradbury-xiong-ea-2017), and **ELMo** (Embeddings from Language Models) [[Peters et al., 2018]](https://d2l.ai/chapter_references/zreferences.html#peters-neumann-iyyer-ea-2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**, by taking the entire sequence as the input, **ELMo** is a function that assigns a representation to each word from the input sequence. **Specifically**, ELMo combines all the intermediate layer representations from pretrained bidirectional LSTM as the output representation. **Then** the ELMo representation will be added to a downstream task’s (下游任务是CV、NLP等，用于评估通过自监督学习学习到的特征的质量，例如CV中的目标检测、语义分割等等) existing supervised model as additional features, such as by concatenating ELMo representation and the original representation (e.g., GloVe) of tokens in the existing model. **On one hand**, all the weights in the pretrained bidirectional LSTM model **are frozen after** ELMo representations are added. **On the other hand**, the existing supervised model is specifically customized for a given task. Leveraging different best models for different tasks at that time, adding ELMo improved the state of the art across six natural language processing tasks: sentiment analysis, natural language inference, semantic role labeling, coreference resolution, named entity recognition, and question answering.\n"

    "\n",
    "The **GPT (Generative Pre-Training) model** represents an effort in designing a general **task-agnostic** model for context-sensitive representations [[Radford et al., 2018]](https://d2l.ai/chapter_references/zreferences.html#radford-narasimhan-salimans-ea-2018). Built on a transformer decoder, GPT pretrains a language model that will be used to represent text sequences. When applying GPT to a downstream task, the output of the language model **will be fed into an added linear output layer** to predict the label of the task.\n",
